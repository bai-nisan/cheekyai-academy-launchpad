## Components

### BlogContent
The main blog article composition component that imports and renders all section components. Previously a monolithic 1263-line file, now refactored into a clean composition.

### Section Components
Each major section of the blog has been extracted into its own component:
- **FrameworkOverview**: Introduction and core components overview
- **EnvironmentPreparation**: Tool setup and environment configuration
- **AIAssistedPlanning**: Creating technical specifications with AI
- **TaskDecomposition**: Breaking down work into manageable tasks
- **ExecutionWorkflow**: Implementation process with AI assistance
- **BestPractices**: Guidelines for each phase
- **ResourcesCommunity**: Learning resources and community links

### BlogHeader
Displays blog post metadata including title, author, date, and read time.

### CodeBlock
Renders syntax-highlighted code with copy functionality and optional collapsible state.

### ReadingProgress
Shows a progress bar indicating how much of the article has been read.

### SocialShare
Provides social media sharing buttons for Twitter, LinkedIn, and link copying.

### TableOfContents
Interactive navigation for jumping between blog sections.

## Refactoring Completed ✅

The BlogContent.tsx has been successfully split into smaller, focused section components. Each section:
- Has a single responsibility
- Uses constants from `constants.ts`
- Follows consistent styling patterns
- Is independently maintainable

## Next Steps

1. **Add Testing**
   - Set up testing infrastructure (Jest + React Testing Library)
   - Add unit tests for each component
   - Focus on user interactions and edge cases

2. **Improve Type Safety**
   - Use the types defined in `types.ts` consistently
   - Add proper prop validation
   - Consider using Zod for runtime validation

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lazy load blog sections below the fold
   - Memoize expensive computations
   - Optimize image loading

## Usage

```tsx
import { 
  BlogHeader, 
  BlogContent, 
  TableOfContents, 
  SocialShare, 
  ReadingProgress 
} from '@/components/blog';

// In your blog post page
<ReadingProgress />
<BlogHeader />
<div className="flex gap-8">
  <BlogContent />
  <aside>
    <TableOfContents activeSection={activeSection} />
    <SocialShare />
  </aside>
</div>
```

## Best Practices

- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Extract constants and configuration to separate files
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Follow the project's styling conventions (Tailwind + shadcn/ui)
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
